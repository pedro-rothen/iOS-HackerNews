The heavy weight of the duopoly made open specs and drivers impossible in the <em>mobile</em> ecosystem l, as every single manufacturer refuses to release their firmware and drivers. A lot of such projects failed in the past despite a significant demand (proved by many sold Pinephones). My phone is based on the motherboard from a completely different industry (automotive). That made this phone very expensive and simultaneously very slow, heavy and inefficient, compared with all modern smartphones. More details: <a href=\"https://puri.sm/posts/breaking-ground\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://puri.sm/posts/breaking-ground</a>. Making this phone almost killed Purism the company; even today they can't provide all promised refunds.<p>&gt; and the thing forcing upgrades is something like their bank not supporting an OS which no longer receives security updates, which won’t be resolved by flashing a completely unsupported OS.<p>Why wouldn't it be resolved by installing a secure, supported GNU/Linux? Only because banks force you into the duopoly. More alternatives would push the change.<p>&gt; If this is your concern, you should be pushing for laws regarding recycling<p>This is exactly why I support forcing Apple to provide a way to run what I want.

            "comment_text": "I do use the Purism phone as a daily driver. The heavy weight of the duopoly made open specs and drivers impossible in the mobile ecosystem l, as every single manufacturer refuses to release their firmware and drivers. A lot of such projects failed in the past despite a significant demand (proved by many sold Pinephones). My phone is based on the motherboard from a completely different industry (automotive). That made this phone very expensive and simultaneously very slow, heavy and inefficient, compared with all modern smartphones. More details: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puri.sm&#x2F;posts&#x2F;breaking-ground\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puri.sm&#x2F;posts&#x2F;breaking-ground</a>. Making this phone almost killed Purism the company; even today they can&#x27;t provide all promised refunds.<p>&gt; and the thing forcing upgrades is something like their bank not supporting an OS which no longer receives security updates, which won’t be resolved by flashing a completely unsupported OS.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t it be resolved by installing a secure, supported GNU&#x2F;Linux? Only because banks force you into the duopoly. More alternatives would push the change.<p>&gt; If this is your concern, you should be pushing for laws regarding recycling<p>This is exactly why I support forcing Apple to provide a way to run what I want.
